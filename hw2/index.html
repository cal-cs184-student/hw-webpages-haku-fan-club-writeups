		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		De Casteljau algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by evaluating on individual Bezier curves parameterized by u, and then 
		evaluating these points on another curve, parameterized by v. The diagram below provides a clear visualization of this process: de 
		Casteljau is first used to evaluate u on each of the Bezier curves, which then act as control points for the "moving" Bezier curve.
		From here, we can simply perform de Casteljau one more time on this new curve to evaluate the final point at the parameter v, which lies on the 
		Bezier surface with the parameters u and v.

		</figure>
		<br>
		For this part, we implemented 3 functions: <code>evaluateStep</code>, <code>evaluate1D</code>, and <code>evaluate</code>:
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li><code>evaluateStep</code>: This function evaluates one step of de Casteljau's algorithm using the given points and the scalar parameter t. To implement this, for every point except the last one, we calculated <code>(1 - t) * points[i] + t * points[i + 1]</code> and stored the values in a <code>Vector3D</code>.</li>
			<li><code>evaluate1D</code>: This function fully evaluates de Casteljau's algorithm and uses the same parameters as <code>evaluateStep</code>. We implemented this function by recursively calling <code>evaluateStep</code> on the current control points until we ended up with only one. Each call to <code>evaluateStep</code> would decrease the number of points by 1. </li>
			<li><code>evaluate</code>: This function evaluates the Bezier patch at parameter (u, v). To implement this function, we first called <code>evaluate1D</code> on all the control points with the parameter u. Then, we stored all these points in a <code>Vector3D</code> and called <code>evaluate1D</code> one more time on this vector, parameterized by v. This yields a final point that lies on the Bezier surface, defined by the n x n points at the parameters u and v. </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To get the area-weighted vertex normal for a given vertex <code>v</code>, we must 1) iterate through all the faces that this vertex is a part of, 2) find the normals of each of those faces, and 3) weight these normals by area of corresponding faces, before we finally 4) add it up and normalize to get the final result.
		<ul>
			<li>To iterate through each face, we started at a half edge <code>h</code> , which was <code>v</code>’s halfedge, and kept setting it to <code> h->twin()->next() </code> until we reached the starting halfedge. What this accomplished was reaching every single halfedge (and thus face) that had v as part of its triangle. 
			</li>
			<li>The next step was to find the normals which we calculated by getting vectors representing 2 edges (by using positions of all 3 vertices of the triangle), and taking their cross product. Then, we got the unit normal by normalizing this cross product. </li>
			<li>To weight the unit normal by area, simply use the fact that area of a triangle can be computed from ½(AxB) where A and B are two edges. Thus the area is just ½ * (cross product of the 2 edges from earlier). And thus the weighted unit normal was  ½ * (cross product of the 2 edges) * unit normal.</li>
			<li>Finally, we just summed up all the weighted unit normals per face into one vector. When we were done, we returned the normalized version of this final vector.</li>
		  </ul>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		To implement the edge flip operation, we first visualized the mesh before and after a flip, labeling every half-edge, vertex, edge, and face, 
		as shown in the diagram below. In our implementation, we rotated all the half-edges that were on the inside (h0, h1, h2, h5, h6, h7) 90 degrees 
		clockwise to flip the desired edge e0. In the <code>flipEdge</code> method, we first reassigned the halfedge pointer for every vertex, edge, and face. After this, we used the 
		<code>Halfedge::setNeighbors</code> method to reassign the correct next, twin, vertex, edge, and face pointers for every half-edge. As 
		recommended, we set the pointers of all the elements in the mesh even if they did not change for clarity and ease when implementing and 
		debugging. Initially, it was difficult understanding which pointers to reassign, but after clearly drawing out all elements before and after 
		modification, we were able to implement the edge flip operation pretty smoothly.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>

		To implement the edge split operation, we generalized how the edge split would change all the halfedges, vertices, faces, and edges of two arbitrary triangles. We listed out all the relations between features both before and after the split, and
		we were confident that we could replicate these changes in code.

		As for the function <code>splitEdge</code>, this is the general process we followed: First, we wanted to have references for every single preexisting feature, so we had <code>Iter</code> elements for every single
		vertex, edge, face, and halfedge. By traversing through the halfedges of each triangle, we were able to get all this information.

		Then, we allocated space for the new halfedges, vertex, edges, and faces using the provided methods, such as <code> newVertex() </code>. After allocating this space, we then just reassigned pointers according to the list we made from earlier.
		It was important to reassign these pointers for every single vertex/edge/face/halfedge, not just the newly added ones. Finally, we updated the position of the new vertex by calculating the midpoint of the given edge.

		As for the debugging journey, one tiny mistake took a bit of time to catch, which wa caused by mislabelling one of the halfedge's <code> next() </code> pointer to go to the wrong halfedge. This caused one whole face to not render properly in the <code>cube.dae</code> file.
		However, we found this error by printing out the addresses of each face, and comparing the addresses using the inspector tool in the GUI. That way, we could see which face was causing the error. Then by comparing every vector/edge/halfedge related to the erroneous face, and double checking our diagram, we caught our one character mistake.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		In our implementation of loop subdivision, we split the process into 5 steps:
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>First, we created a helper method <code>updateOldVertex</code>, which computed new positions for all the vertices in 
				the input mesh using the loop subdivision rule: <br><br>(1 - \(n\) * \(u\)) * original_position + \(u\) * original_neighbor_position_sum
				<br><br>In this equation, \(n\) is the degree of the vertex, \(u\) is \(3/16\) if \(n = 3\) and \(3/8n\) otherwise. original_position is 
				the position of the current vertex, and original_neighbor_position_sum is the sum of all the positions of that vertex's neighbors. For each
				 vertex v, we set <code>v->newPosition</code> to this computed value. In this step, we also set <code>v->isNew</code> for these vertices to be false. </li>
			<li>Then, we created another helper method <code>updateNewVertex</code>, which computed the updated vertex positions associated with 
				edges in the mesh and stored them in <code>e->newPosition</code> for each edge e. For a pair of triangles with vertices A, B, C, and D, 
				where the new vertex is splitting the shared edge (A, B), the newPosition is calculated as 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D), where A, B, C, and D 
				are the positions of the vertices. We also set <code>e->isNew</code> to false for each of these edges. </li>
			<li>In the next step, we split every edge in the mesh. For every edge, we called <code>edgeSplit</code> from the previous task, which would 
				return a <code>VertexIter</code>, which we called <code>newSplitVertex</code>. We set <code>newSplitVertex->isNew</code> to true and also 
				assigned <code>newPosition</code> to the original edge's <code>newPosition</code>. We then traversed through the half-edges of the 
				triangle pair that has been split, assigning the <code>isNew</code> attribute accordingly. The diagram below is a more detailed visualization 
				of this traversal. 
				<figure>
					<img src="p6-diagram.jpeg" alt="Part 6 Diagram" style="width:30%"/>
					<figcaption>visualization of step 3 isNew assignments</figcaption>
				</figure></li>
			<li>Then, we flipped any new edges that connected an old and new vertex using the <code>edgeFlip</code> method from part 4 from above. We iterated through 
				all the mesh edges and checked if the corresponding vertices A and B were true/false or false/true. If so, we flipped the edge. </li>
			<li>Finally, in the last step, we updated all the vertex positions by assigning <code>v->position = v->newPosition</code> for every vertex in the mesh, as 
				we had calculated all the newPositions in steps 1 and 2. </li>
			<br>
			
		</ol>

		When implementing, we were initially having difficulty with all the different calculations, but when following the recommendations to break the task
		 into smaller parts and calculating all the vertex positions before performing any edge flips and splits, as well as drawing out diagrams, helped us 
		 more easily implement the loop subdivision method. 

		<br><br>
		Here, we have an example of a teapot mesh that has undergone loop subdivision. The more we upsample, the smoother corners and edges become, as we can see 
		in the subsequent photos below. However, with sharp features, they may slightly lose their original shape, as they become smoothed out. One way to avoid this 
		is to pre-process by splitting edges near these features so there are more vertices before calling loop subdivision. This would help better preserve the original 
		shape of the mesh and the sharpness of certain features.

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<br><br>

		We also performed several iterations of loop subdivision on <code>cube.dae</code>, as shown below: 

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Original cube</figcaption>

					<figcaption>After 4 loop subdivisions</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br>
		However, we can see that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. This is because some of the subdivisions are uneven, 
		as the original mesh isn't uniform. Not all diagonal edges on the faces are in the same orientation in the original cube mesh, and as we repeatedly call loop 
		subdivisions,  we can see the asymmetry more clearly. To avoid this, we can pre-process the cube to make it more symmetrical and uniform, for example 
		by calling splitting the diagonal edge on every face, and then calling loop subdivision after this. The results of doing this are shown below: 

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
